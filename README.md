# Boris Bikes
This is a project that will emulate docking stations, bikes and infrastructure.

### Bike class
This class is for instances of bikes. They currently have an empty method called 'working' which will later check if the bikes are in a good condition.

### DockingStation class
This class is for instances of docking stations. They currently have an empty method called 'release_bike' which will later be used to release an instance of a bike from the docking station.
